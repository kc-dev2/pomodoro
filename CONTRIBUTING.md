## Code of Conduct

By contributing to this project, you are expected to adhere to [this project's Code of Conduct](https://github.com/knjk04/pomodoro/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 

## Questions, suggestions & feedback

All questions, suggestions and feedback are both welcome and encouraged. 

Questions and feedback should be sent to pomodoro@madebykarankumar.com. 

For suggestions, please vote on, or add to, the existing relevant issue. If no such issue exists, feel free to open a new issue.

## Before making changes

### Tell us what issue you want to work on

*This applies to both code and documentation changes.*

If an issue already exists for what you want to work and it is unassigned, and it is not labelled as blocked, feel free to let us know that you want to work on it. We can then assign you to it. If an issue doesn't already exist, please create one and then let us know that you are happy to work on it.

Letting us know which issue you want to work on before working on it helps to minimise the chances of duplicated work.

### Discuss your implementation approach

After having been assigned to a ticket, please discuss your implementation approach with us first before working on it. It may be the case that you make a good change, but it isn't what we are looking for. Moreover, there may be a better way of doing something.

This step can help to save both your time and our time in the long run :)

## Workflow

Please follow the process below:

1. Tell us which issue you want to work on
2. Discuss your implementation approach with us
3. Fork the repository
4. Create a new branch off master (unless the corresponding issue says otherwise). Your branch should have a descriptive branch name (that corresponds to the relevant issue) and include the issue number (e.g. `iss1048-add-styleguide`)
5. Submit a pull request to merge into the branch specified on the issue

### Commit messages

Use the present tense (e.g. "add converter", not "added converter") for git commit messages.

Please also ensure that your commit messages are descriptive (i.e. a commit message should effectively summarise what change(s) you made).

### One problem per patch

For every patch you make, please ensure it solves only one problem. If you want to solve multiple problems, please spread them across multiple patches -- one patch per problem.

This makes it easier to keep track of what changes were made in what branch or pull request when looking back.

## Code contributions

Please adhere to [our Java style guide](https://github.com/knjk04/pomodoro/blob/master/STYLEGUIDE.md).
